I always paid off my credit card in full every month.</p>\n<p><strong>Our goal was clear — save up for our home deposit.</strong></p>\n<p>But we took on bad debt last year.</p>\n<p>We bought a seven seater Nissan Pathfinder through a car loan. We <em>needed</em> a car to fit a family of five plus guests. We ended up getting $34K debt at 9.75% interest.</p>\n<p>We had some money stashed away for the home deposit. We kept paying minimum payments on the car loan.</p>\n<p>When I did the math, the decision was obvious. We’re better off to use our saved up money which was $20K towards the car loan.</p>\n<p>I am happy to report we’ll regain control of our lives by September 2019.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Domino your debts","date":"August 03, 2019","description":"Today you’re going to regain control of your life."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/domino-your-debts/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gatsbyjs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GatsbyJS"}},"next":null}}}
