This is now a waiting game.</li>\n<li>All we need to do is wait for the oath taking schedule.</li>\n<li>Attend with the whole family.</li>\n<li>Once that’s done, we’ll wait for another few weeks until we can apply for our Australian Passports.</li>\n<li>Which leads us to the next big rock for 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Japan Family Travel</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We have set this goal and budget last year.</li>\n<li>We’ve set a $12 000 budget for this.</li>\n<li>We have saved up the bulk of this budget with $1 000 to go.</li>\n<li>We still haven’t decided for a specific itinerary but that’s enough once we have completed our requirements.</li>\n<li>Once we’ve received our Australian passports, we’re ready to book our trip.</li>\n<li>Part of this travel is the possibility of making it a multi-city trip where we can stop by the Philippines so the kids can meet their relatives back home. (Not actually home for us)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mama’s arrival back in Australia</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We have applied for Mama’s visa. We’re waiting for approval.</li>\n<li>Mama’s a vital part of our household.

(Read between the lines)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Body Plan</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Last quarter of 2019 I have set a goal to be in my best shape ever when I turn 40.</li>\n<li>I am still working on it till now. I have two more weeks to complete my first every muscle building program.</li>\n<li>After my initial program, I will make an assessment on what went well, what did not work and what can I do to improve?\nFrom that review — I shall make some tweaks and continue building my best body ever!</li>\n<li>I have developed great habits to make this happen.</li>\n<li>Like consistently going to the gym 4x week. Eating well 80% of the time.</li>\n<li>I am confident I will be able to achieve this before my 40th comes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Kick Goals @ My job</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This is my second year at work.</li>\n<li>I have been playing it safe for the past year.</li>\n<li>I feel I have warmed up enough and know a lot of people already to navigate my way around work.</li>\n<li>This year, I’d be bolder and take more risks at work.</li>\n<li>Contribute as much as I can so I could move my way up.</li>\n<li>I love working at my current job, and actually enjoying it.</li>\n<li>I want to be a major contributor at my work and take on more responsibilities.</li>\n<li>The goal is to develop the right habits to be in the position where my work will get noticed.</li>\n<li>Have a big impact on the business and in my pocket.</li>\n<li>The more I learn the more I know, the more places I shall go!</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Big rocks","date":"January 19, 2020","description":"These are our goals set for 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/big-rocks/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/finish-strong/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish strong"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-double-your-income/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to double your income according to Barefoot Investor"}}}}}
