I enrolled in a proper gym last week.</p>\n<p>I turned one year @ Sportsbet. To be honest, I had a stressful first year. I had the best support at the company but I think it was just me. I was too anxious at work. I thought stressing out was the norm. I thought getting more hours in will get the work done quicker. But the more stressed I get, I make more mistakes. The more anxious I get. It’s a vicious cycle.</p>\n<p>I finally took advantage of the company’s gym membership perks. Instead of thinking I could not afford it, I thought it is a small price to pay for good health — which is irreplaceable. I recognise that this the first step. What matters most is what I do with it the following days, months, years.</p>\n<p><strong>The goal is before I turn 40 @ 2020. I am in my best shape ever</strong></p>\n<h2>My mentors</h2>\n<p>These guys are worth a follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bholinka/\">Brian Holinka</a> - game designer.
