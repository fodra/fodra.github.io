My first session was awesome.</p>\n<p>Here’s a few things I found helpful in the program:</p>\n<h3>1. Warm up sets</h3>\n<p>This book recommends doing warm up sets. Do 2 sets of the exercise using very light weights.\nAfter the two sets, do additional 3 sets with the proper weight — enough to challenge you.</p>\n<h3>2. Pre-workout snack</h3>\n<p>That’s basically a banana for me an hour before going to the gym. It works for me.</p>\n<h3>3. Squeezing the bar</h3>\n<p>This one is effective for me. It improves my grip strength and it helps me actively attack the exercises when I’m doing the reps.</p>\n<p>Eight weeks from now, I’d be finished with the program.</p>\n<p>Just in time to welcome the new year with a new body!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New body plan","date":"November 11, 2019","description":"If you don't have a plan, it's a wish."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/new-body-plan/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-do-i-move-up/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do I move up?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/eoy-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EOY 2019"}}}}}
