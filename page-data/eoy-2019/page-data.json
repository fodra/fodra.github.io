Family &#x26; Friends</h2>\n<p>I’ll make sure we’ll reconnect with friends and family over the long holiday break.</p>\n<p>I don’t plan to spend a lot of money during the holidays giving unwanted gifts. I want to spend my time visiting friends during this period.</p>\n<p>We have arranged for a road trip to Sydney for about a week. This will be our first time to go there. It will be really good.</p>\n<h2>2. Up skill</h2>\n<p>Starting this week it will be a great time to pick up some new and helpful skills that I could use to further my career.</p>\n<p>I’m thinking picking up some GraphQL and React skills. There’s a <a href=\"https://www.howtographql.com/\">site</a> I booked marked for this purpose.</p>\n<p>It will also be beneficial to interact with people who are in the same learning boat.</p>\n<h2>3. New body plan</h2>\n<p>It’s no secret I am on a weight training program. I got myself into the <a href=\"https://fodra.github.io/new-body-plan/\">New Body Plan</a>. I just started this program last week. The end of this program perfectly coincides with the start of the new year 2020.</p>\n<p>New year, new body. That’s the plan.</p>\n<p>I picked up a new way of eating. I also got into the protein powder stuff after workouts. I am lifting progressively.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These areas are my main focus now and for the year to come. For just an <a href=\"https://www.thecoffeeshoptrader.com/2016/05/work-determines-future-spend-one-hour-per-day-five-things-life-will-change.html\">hour a day</a>, I can make positive changes.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"EOY 2019","date":"November 18, 2019","description":"Now is not the time to slow down.
