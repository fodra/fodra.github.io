I started slow.</p>\n<p>First I only did cardio on the rowing machine — built my overall endurance and fitness level.</p>\n<p>Then I reached out to twitter #gymbros for a <a href=\"https://fodra.github.io/beginner-workout/\">basic full body workout</a>.</p>\n<p>I built basic strength and familiarised myself with the gym equipment.</p>\n<p>I moved on to the <a href=\"https://fodra.github.io/new-body-plan/\">New Body Plan program</a> after a few months. I am still going with the program.</p>\n<p>I had a few days of bumps along the way as I hurt my back when I started — I was doing heavy weights with bad form while doing the goblet squat. Then I encountered another foot injury half-way into the program. I got disappointed by the down time.</p>\n<p>Thank God, visits to the physio and chiropractor brought me back to the gym. It took a few off days but it was well worth it.</p>\n<p>For the last day of 2019, I decided to finish strong.</p>\n<p>I put in the work at the gym to close off 2019. I finished week 5 of block 3 for my gym session. I’ll take a off loading week at the start of 2020 for a much deserved break.</p>\n<p>Overall it has been a good year for me and my family. I encourage everyone to finish strong for 2019. Forget the new year’s resolutions.</p>\n<p>Do it now and finish the year with a strong note!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish strong","date":"December 31, 2019","description":"Strength training mindset."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/finish-strong/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/atomic-habits/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Atomic Habits"}},"next":null}}}
